# Port Configuration Cleanup

## Issue Identified
The application had multiple React instances running on different ports, causing confusion and potential conflicts:
- **Port 3001**: React frontend (correct)
- **Port 3002**: Backend server (correct)  
- **Port 3003**: Extra React frontend instance (incorrect - removed)

## Problem
- Multiple React development servers were running simultaneously
- Port 3003 had an unnecessary duplicate React instance
- This could cause confusion about which frontend to use
- Potential resource waste and port conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Port Cleanup
- **Identified running processes** using `netstat -ano | findstr :300`
- **Terminated unnecessary process** on port 3003 (PID 32960)
- **Terminated conflicting process** on port 3001 (PID 11320)
- **Kept backend server** running on port 3002 (PID 33020)

### 2. Correct Configuration Established
```
✅ Frontend (React):  http://localhost:3001
✅ Backend (Express): http://localhost:3002
❌ Removed: Extra React instance on port 3003
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
The `.env` file was already correctly configured:
```env
# Frontend Configuration
PORT=3001

# Database Configuration (for backend)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=online_bookstore
JWT_SECRET=3118a208506b7bcb4dd575eb3a9780bfa36e32c577e6c7c86e0a460f2b524b8016a2133261aa06dcd7ce92edfd9452f3c9542ea9121672fced8426c008ac6245
```

### 4. Process Management
- **Frontend**: Started with `npm start` (uses PORT=3001 from .env)
- **Backend**: Running with `npm start` in backend directory (port 3002)
- **Clean startup**: No port conflicts or duplicate instances

## Current Status

### ✅ **Correct Setup**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 (React development server)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3002 (Express API server)
- **Database**: MySQL on localhost (online_bookstore)

### ✅ **Verified Working**
- Cart functionality working properly
- Login page accessible
- API communication between frontend and backend
- All pages loading with improved padding
- Toast notifications functioning

### ✅ **Process IDs**
- **Frontend PID**: 53772 (port 3001)
- **Backend PID**: 33020 (port 3002)

## Commands Used for Cleanup

### Port Investigation
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3002  
netstat -ano | findstr :3003
```

### Process Termination
```powershell
taskkill /PID 32960 /F  # Removed extra React on port 3003
taskkill /PID 11320 /F  # Removed conflicting React on port 3001
```

### Restart Frontend
```bash
npm start  # Uses PORT=3001 from .env file
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

### 1. **Resource Optimization**
- Eliminated unnecessary React development server
- Reduced memory and CPU usage
- Cleaner process management

### 2. **Clarity**
- Single frontend instance on designated port
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- No confusion about which URL to use

### 3. **Development Efficiency**
- Faster development workflow
- No port conflicts
- Consistent environment across team

### 4. **Production Readiness**
- Clean port configuration
- Proper environment setup
- Ready for deployment scripts

## Future Recommendations

### 1. **Development Scripts**
Consider adding these scripts to package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run backend\" \"npm start\"",
    "backend": "cd backend && npm start",
    "kill-ports": "npx kill-port 3001 3002 3003"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Port Management**
- Always check running processes before starting development
- Use consistent port numbers across team
- Document port usage in README

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- Keep .env file updated
- Use different ports for different environments
- Consider using docker-compose for complex setups

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Frontend loads correctly on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Backend API responds on http://localhost:3002
- ✅ Cart functionality works
- ✅ Login page accessible
- ✅ All navigation working
- ✅ Database connections stable
- ✅ No port conflicts

The application is now running with the correct port configuration and is ready for continued development and eventual GitHub deployment.
